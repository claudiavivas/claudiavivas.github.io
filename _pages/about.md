I am an undergraduate student of Economics at PUCP. I am interested in Behavorial Economics, Health Economics, Political Economics, Applied Microeconomics, Gender and Inequality. 

## Time to grow
I am currently collaborating in the development of Time to grow, a social project that takes place in Pamplona Alta, San Juan de Miraflores, Lima, Peru, which aims to empower women recyclers in the area and strengthen community ties through the construction of an urban garden. The implementation team is made up of members of [Reciclaje.pe](https://reciclaje.pe/) and [Ocupa tu Calle (OTC)](https://ocupatucalle.com/).
